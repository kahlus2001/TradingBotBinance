# Trading Bot Binance

This is a cryptocurrency trading bot, which logs into my Binance account and pulls data using their API.
It analyzes the data, and based on some technical price indicators, it can place buy or sell orders on the exchange,
using my account. The trading strategy is still not ideal. In order to run the code, one
must have a .txt file with the private and public keys to my binance account.
